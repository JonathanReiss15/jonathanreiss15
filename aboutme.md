My name is Jonny, or Jonathan, Reiss, and I am a software engineer born and raised just outside of Nashville, TN to newly relocated to Seattle, WA via Phoenix, AZ where I attended Arizona State University.

A couple things I am passionate about:
- Node.js
- The [Waffle House Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waffle_House_Index)
- Using Open Source Intelligence for good
- Frontend development tools
- Locally roasted coffee
- IPAs
- Cooking (especially Instant Pot meals for two)

I want to learn more about:
- Foreign policy
- Open Source Software development
- Tech policy
- Encryption
- Computer vision
- Homebrewing
